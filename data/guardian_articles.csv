03f03c1e-927d-4c1d-a485-522f17dfc0f4,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/feb/04/police-investigating-serious-incident-de-montfort-university-leicester,2026-02-04,Man arrested after fatal stabbing in Leicester city centre,"Police say 18-year-old arrested on suspicion of murder after death of man in his 20s on Tuesday evening An 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a student in his 20s was stabbed in Leicester city centre and later died in hospital, Leicestershire police have said. Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
bfb32b3d-35e5-4fe2-8419-a461849eabf7,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"
ece4152a-2655-463e-af8f-6aae8fbe3c94,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2026/feb/04/donald-trump-epstein-files-us-politics-live-latest-news-updates,2026-02-04,LiveTrump calls for Americans to ‘move on’ from Epstein files – US politics live,"President’s commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and on-off ally Elon Musk have both featured in the Epstein files Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”."

Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
32f0adcf-79c9-4797-a630-47047ab3a37a,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"

The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
adfab499-fc33-40f7-8597-d9d7e45d2ec0,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"
04338cbb-6bef-4410-a180-1cbc9468ef74,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2026/feb/04/donald-trump-epstein-files-us-politics-live-latest-news-updates,2026-02-04,LiveTrump calls for Americans to ‘move on’ from Epstein files – US politics live,"President’s commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and on-off ally Elon Musk have both featured in the Epstein files Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”."
320589b5-00b7-49b2-939d-ed7659033196,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/04/essex-university-southend-campus-closure-seaside-deprivation,2026-02-04,"‘If I think about what this means, I want to cry’: what happens when a city loses its university?","When Essex University’s Southend campus opened, it was a message of hope for a ‘left behind’ UK seaside town. Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
aacc2032-9d92-4449-a060-aacfd4e6cf14,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"

The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
be21f61f-fe51-4b6e-847c-94efc8a91429,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"

President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March.

868ba9af-64be-477c-9061-a9c20eb1c19e,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/04/essex-university-southend-campus-closure-seaside-deprivation,2026-02-04,"‘If I think about what this means, I want to cry’: what happens when a city loses its university?","When Essex University’s Southend campus opened, it was a message of hope for a ‘left behind’ UK seaside town. Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
fceeac99-63ca-4660-bdbc-48e6ebf6d923,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"
3b364853-6c79-4da6-8004-adeb5127b404,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/feb/04/rail-firm-issues-do-not-travel-alert-after-multiple-incidents-across-south-east-england,2026-02-04,South-east England ‘do not travel’ rail alert lifted but disruption continues,"Signalling issue and train derailment still affecting Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express services The UK’s largest railway franchise has lifted a “do not travel alert” it had issued after a train derailment and signalling issues affected services across south-east England, but service disruption continues. The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"

In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"

President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March.

Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
a393e1bd-ab97-4b18-80f5-6fb70e384985,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"
652b8553-6fff-413d-89fa-202b6f41dd15,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/feb/04/rail-firm-issues-do-not-travel-alert-after-multiple-incidents-across-south-east-england,2026-02-04,South-east England ‘do not travel’ rail alert lifted but disruption continues,"Signalling issue and train derailment still affecting Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express services The UK’s largest railway franchise has lifted a “do not travel alert” it had issued after a train derailment and signalling issues affected services across south-east England, but service disruption continues. The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
f3a61e9c-5a00-4a18-8020-50e8822f45e8,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"

President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March.

Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
c668b95c-e874-41e8-be13-aef31445f209,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"
1a1dba34-122b-42cd-b68d-06d808104b24,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/feb/04/rail-firm-issues-do-not-travel-alert-after-multiple-incidents-across-south-east-england,2026-02-04,South-east England ‘do not travel’ rail alert lifted but disruption continues,"Signalling issue and train derailment still affecting Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express services The UK’s largest railway franchise has lifted a “do not travel alert” it had issued after a train derailment and signalling issues affected services across south-east England, but service disruption continues. The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
adad603c-f5c9-49dd-8fb5-a0a991994620,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"

President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March.

The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”."

Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
a9e504ab-f17b-439a-b2ff-3e3ecf036206,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"

The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
98d99fa5-f2b4-4b44-83e2-854a7cde7f9c,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"
ae94376a-ffec-4731-b15a-c91e939c9502,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2026/feb/04/donald-trump-epstein-files-us-politics-live-latest-news-updates,2026-02-04,LiveTrump calls for Americans to ‘move on’ from Epstein files – US politics live,"President’s commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and on-off ally Elon Musk have both featured in the Epstein files Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”."

Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
8527c5e8-c138-4b31-b772-749deb4ea88f,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"

The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
e62cb9de-22ac-4cb9-9c2a-3d850faafd76,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"
2c19290f-c749-4213-babc-2ae30bba664e,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2026/feb/04/donald-trump-epstein-files-us-politics-live-latest-news-updates,2026-02-04,LiveTrump calls for Americans to ‘move on’ from Epstein files – US politics live,"President’s commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and on-off ally Elon Musk have both featured in the Epstein files Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”."
f5ca6df6-cf07-4877-b576-3ea5cb015bdc,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/04/essex-university-southend-campus-closure-seaside-deprivation,2026-02-04,"‘If I think about what this means, I want to cry’: what happens when a city loses its university?","When Essex University’s Southend campus opened, it was a message of hope for a ‘left behind’ UK seaside town. Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
f1ba5315-3d95-4a84-a490-57dadfeaaf2a,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"
bfb6f0f5-ea3c-43c6-9bb9-b98ae5e9dd37,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/feb/04/rail-firm-issues-do-not-travel-alert-after-multiple-incidents-across-south-east-england,2026-02-04,South-east England ‘do not travel’ rail alert lifted but disruption continues,"Signalling issue and train derailment still affecting Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express services The UK’s largest railway franchise has lifted a “do not travel alert” it had issued after a train derailment and signalling issues affected services across south-east England, but service disruption continues. The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
1b11815c-f6c5-4adb-a008-fd16ab45da26,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"

President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March.

Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”."

Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
8038ae07-2bb4-4eb7-8aa0-8758cfa6522a,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"

The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
324b2e9b-504a-491e-81c4-ae9064ccf2bc,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"

President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”."
324c6313-385c-4bc0-90c3-47763d5a1627,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/04/essex-university-southend-campus-closure-seaside-deprivation,2026-02-04,"‘If I think about what this means, I want to cry’: what happens when a city loses its university?","When Essex University’s Southend campus opened, it was a message of hope for a ‘left behind’ UK seaside town. Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
89ae6e64-65d9-4873-8782-191bbf192860,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"

The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
bcb14cfe-5404-49f6-8c08-622bb1716b46,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"

President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March.

089f647a-fa06-423d-97b6-6d88c817806e,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/04/essex-university-southend-campus-closure-seaside-deprivation,2026-02-04,"‘If I think about what this means, I want to cry’: what happens when a city loses its university?","When Essex University’s Southend campus opened, it was a message of hope for a ‘left behind’ UK seaside town. Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
dcd7dc6e-31e8-4eb9-a31a-8f872ae62095,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"
5b9ba264-fc09-404e-bc9d-f94665221f27,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/feb/04/rail-firm-issues-do-not-travel-alert-after-multiple-incidents-across-south-east-england,2026-02-04,South-east England ‘do not travel’ rail alert lifted but disruption continues,"Signalling issue and train derailment still affecting Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express services The UK’s largest railway franchise has lifted a “do not travel alert” it had issued after a train derailment and signalling issues affected services across south-east England, but service disruption continues. The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Along with advertising and reader revenue, this is one of the ways that we fund Guardian journalism. The presentation of the content makes clear how the content has been commissioned and produced, and who has funded it. One of four labels will appear on this content: ‘Supported by’, ‘Advertising partner/Exclusive advertising partner’, ‘Paid content/Paid for by’, or ‘Advertiser content/from our advertisers’. ‘Supported by’ is used to describe editorially independent content. We accept funding from third parties both for new projects and for content we are already producing. Before funding is agreed with a client, relevant senior editors are consulted about its suitability and the editor-in-chief has the final say on whether a funding deal is accepted. A client whose branding appears on editorial content may have a role in suggesting what kind of topics are covered, but the commissioning editor is not obliged to accept ideas from the funder. The content is written and edited by Guardian journalists, or those approved by GNM, to the same standards expected in all of our journalism. GNM will not show copy to funders for approval. ‘Supported by’ is also used to describe editorially independent content that the Guardian has produced with funding from foundations around the world who support specific projects. A full list of our philanthropic projects can be found here. ‘Advertising partner/Exclusive advertising partner’ is used by Guardian US to describe editorially independent content funded by commercial third parties as set out above. This label is never applied to content produced with funding from foundations. ‘Paid content/paid for by’ is used to describe advertisement features that are paid for and controlled by the advertiser rather than the publisher and are subject to regulation by the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK, the Federal Trade Commission in the US and the Advertising Standards Bureau in Australia.

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
189fafd8-49cd-4834-89f7-9687b74774e0,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"

President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March.

In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”."

Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
3a2ed282-55d6-47d9-a8a5-99eddd4aefdd,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"

The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
e0e0ae78-6807-41e8-abcb-981f04661ba9,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"
d4b0014f-4ef1-4e2f-9d86-c0de87222719,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2026/feb/04/donald-trump-epstein-files-us-politics-live-latest-news-updates,2026-02-04,LiveTrump calls for Americans to ‘move on’ from Epstein files – US politics live,"President’s commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and on-off ally Elon Musk have both featured in the Epstein files Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”."
8c582656-6c2d-4740-8df8-3fbb20192b06,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/04/essex-university-southend-campus-closure-seaside-deprivation,2026-02-04,"‘If I think about what this means, I want to cry’: what happens when a city loses its university?","When Essex University’s Southend campus opened, it was a message of hope for a ‘left behind’ UK seaside town. Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
926d4986-752c-4265-8401-6308c40cb700,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"

The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
6e96319c-0d91-45d9-9067-61c15ed386d7,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"
420bc8de-ad1a-4a20-b7a5-e17ec09ef766,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2026/feb/04/donald-trump-epstein-files-us-politics-live-latest-news-updates,2026-02-04,LiveTrump calls for Americans to ‘move on’ from Epstein files – US politics live,"President’s commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and on-off ally Elon Musk have both featured in the Epstein files Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism.

47949074-4c66-49d9-9915-e9daafe1b92f,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/04/essex-university-southend-campus-closure-seaside-deprivation,2026-02-04,"‘If I think about what this means, I want to cry’: what happens when a city loses its university?","When Essex University’s Southend campus opened, it was a message of hope for a ‘left behind’ UK seaside town. Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
c21c09c5-6b1d-4400-b5bf-f5f3ab44a1e8,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"

The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"

In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"

President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March.

Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
f5fc1697-b2a0-47a0-a4c5-982df27fba32,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"
48d3da48-ab45-43dd-b2e1-b0151122adee,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/feb/04/rail-firm-issues-do-not-travel-alert-after-multiple-incidents-across-south-east-england,2026-02-04,South-east England ‘do not travel’ rail alert lifted but disruption continues,"Signalling issue and train derailment still affecting Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express services The UK’s largest railway franchise has lifted a “do not travel alert” it had issued after a train derailment and signalling issues affected services across south-east England, but service disruption continues. The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
8b1db2ef-2136-40d2-9aaa-73168a1346fb,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"

President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March.

Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
96ae145c-a101-4afc-9a49-d004be397721,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"
cde3d0f3-e13d-4c9c-a1c5-9ca24fd0b2d6,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/feb/04/rail-firm-issues-do-not-travel-alert-after-multiple-incidents-across-south-east-england,2026-02-04,South-east England ‘do not travel’ rail alert lifted but disruption continues,"Signalling issue and train derailment still affecting Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express services The UK’s largest railway franchise has lifted a “do not travel alert” it had issued after a train derailment and signalling issues affected services across south-east England, but service disruption continues. The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
fd65239a-035e-4ee6-9fbd-06eaf4209c88,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"
4b17b9da-50ab-40fc-8fe3-af5966456bf5,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2026/feb/04/donald-trump-epstein-files-us-politics-live-latest-news-updates,2026-02-04,LiveTrump calls for Americans to ‘move on’ from Epstein files – US politics live,"President’s commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and on-off ally Elon Musk have both featured in the Epstein files Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”."
8020f854-610b-44c1-80f8-d2f7e857cbc9,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/04/essex-university-southend-campus-closure-seaside-deprivation,2026-02-04,"‘If I think about what this means, I want to cry’: what happens when a city loses its university?","When Essex University’s Southend campus opened, it was a message of hope for a ‘left behind’ UK seaside town. Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
a922a221-cc74-4239-b33a-0a962da65fff,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time.

The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
74e7adf1-8dd7-4e7d-a647-dff875aefe1e,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"

President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March.

16428130-9921-4136-913a-df172b581bf2,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/04/essex-university-southend-campus-closure-seaside-deprivation,2026-02-04,"‘If I think about what this means, I want to cry’: what happens when a city loses its university?","When Essex University’s Southend campus opened, it was a message of hope for a ‘left behind’ UK seaside town. Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
15806dae-e64b-49c5-93ae-a3176292c4d8,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"
cbcf2270-e9bf-454b-a5a3-e9c8c8a3aeb5,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/feb/04/rail-firm-issues-do-not-travel-alert-after-multiple-incidents-across-south-east-england,2026-02-04,South-east England ‘do not travel’ rail alert lifted but disruption continues,"Signalling issue and train derailment still affecting Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express services The UK’s largest railway franchise has lifted a “do not travel alert” it had issued after a train derailment and signalling issues affected services across south-east England, but service disruption continues. The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Along with advertising and reader revenue, this is one of the ways that we fund Guardian journalism. The presentation of the content makes clear how the content has been commissioned and produced, and who has funded it. One of four labels will appear on this content: ‘Supported by’, ‘Advertising partner/Exclusive advertising partner’, ‘Paid content/Paid for by’, or ‘Advertiser content/from our advertisers’. ‘Supported by’ is used to describe editorially independent content. We accept funding from third parties both for new projects and for content we are already producing. Before funding is agreed with a client, relevant senior editors are consulted about its suitability and the editor-in-chief has the final say on whether a funding deal is accepted. A client whose branding appears on editorial content may have a role in suggesting what kind of topics are covered, but the commissioning editor is not obliged to accept ideas from the funder. The content is written and edited by Guardian journalists, or those approved by GNM, to the same standards expected in all of our journalism. GNM will not show copy to funders for approval. ‘Supported by’ is also used to describe editorially independent content that the Guardian has produced with funding from foundations around the world who support specific projects. A full list of our philanthropic projects can be found here. ‘Advertising partner/Exclusive advertising partner’ is used by Guardian US to describe editorially independent content funded by commercial third parties as set out above. This label is never applied to content produced with funding from foundations. ‘Paid content/paid for by’ is used to describe advertisement features that are paid for and controlled by the advertiser rather than the publisher and are subject to regulation by the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK, the Federal Trade Commission in the US and the Advertising Standards Bureau in Australia.

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"

In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
7e895ad7-945a-4d8c-b383-773b25e650df,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"

President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March.

Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
b858c246-3059-4dcb-9df6-27fbef0658a7,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"

The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"
6c89a793-095a-4202-84fc-def84139b877,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/feb/04/peter-mandelson-files-us-ambassador-jeffrey-epstein-keir-starmer-tories-uk-politics-live-news-updates,2026-02-04,LiveAngela Rayner leads Labour MP calls to back Tory demand for independent ruling on release of Mandelson files – UK politics live,"Former deputy PM says allowing intelligence and security committee to rule on redactions would help ‘keep public confidence in the process’ Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"

In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"

President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March.

4018aadc-ab82-4fbb-80c2-f3c247c02121,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/04/essex-university-southend-campus-closure-seaside-deprivation,2026-02-04,"‘If I think about what this means, I want to cry’: what happens when a city loses its university?","When Essex University’s Southend campus opened, it was a message of hope for a ‘left behind’ UK seaside town. Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
03b156a8-9964-4af7-95ce-a1379e8f6a9a,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"
7f7cb3d3-dbe2-4e8e-bc44-b0e93a5a7de5,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/feb/04/rail-firm-issues-do-not-travel-alert-after-multiple-incidents-across-south-east-england,2026-02-04,South-east England ‘do not travel’ rail alert lifted but disruption continues,"Signalling issue and train derailment still affecting Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express services The UK’s largest railway franchise has lifted a “do not travel alert” it had issued after a train derailment and signalling issues affected services across south-east England, but service disruption continues. The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."

628d33c6-5f9e-4cdd-8f8b-91be901067a0,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2026/feb/04/police-investigating-serious-incident-de-montfort-university-leicester,2026-02-04,Man arrested after fatal stabbing in Leicester city centre,"Police say 18-year-old arrested on suspicion of murder after death of man in his 20s on Tuesday evening An 18-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a student in his 20s was stabbed in Leicester city centre and later died in hospital, Leicestershire police have said. Police and East Midlands ambulance service were called just after 5pm on Tuesday after reports that a man had collapsed. They later received reports that the man had been stabbed. The ambulance service took the individual to Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he died a short time later, police said. An 18-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody, the force added in a statement. The vice-chancellor of De Montfort University confirmed that the man who died in the stabbing was a student. “We are devastated to confirm the tragic death of one of our students,” Katie Normington said. “Our thoughts are with everyone who is affected by what has happened. “We are offering direct support to the students, staff and the family of the victim.” Initial inquiries carried out by officers suggested the victim had been involved in an altercation with another man in the street, who left the scene before police arrived. The senior investigating officer, DI Lorna Granville, said: “We are currently piecing together exactly what has occurred on the corner of Oxford Street and Bonners Lane between, what is reported as, two men involved in a confrontation. “CCTV in the area is currently being reviewed and officers are speaking to potential witnesses to assist with our investigation. We know a lot of people came to the aid of the victim before emergency services arrived and we want to thank them for their help.” Officers are urging potential witnesses to come forward, including motorists who may have captured footage on dashcams. “The incident happened at 5pm so we know the area was also busy with motorists driving along Oxford Street,” Granville said. Earlier on Wednesday, Liz Kendall, the MP for Leicester West and a cabinet minister, said she was aware of a “serious incident” that had taken place and her thoughts were with those affected. Police said the incident had caused “major disruption in the city” as forensic and search specialists carried out examinations. Closures were in place on Oxford Street, Infirmary Road, Infirmary Square, Carlton Street, York Road, Lower Brown Street, the Gateway and Gosling Street. The Infirmary Road junction with Aylestone Road and the Newarke Street junction with Oxford Street were also closed. University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust warned patients with appointments on Wednesday of potential disruption owing to road closures around Leicester Royal Infirmary. It said in a statement on Facebook: “Due to road closures currently in place near the hospital following an overnight incident, there will be traffic disruption in the area this morning. Please attend your appointment and allow extra time for your journey. Follow local diversions and police instructions. If you are delayed, please contact your clinic or department where possible.”"
4d4cb5d9-0697-4b13-ab59-1e4d10b3688b,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2026/feb/04/peter-mandelson-files-us-ambassador-jeffrey-epstein-keir-starmer-tories-uk-politics-live-news-updates,2026-02-04,LiveAngela Rayner leads Labour MP calls to back Tory demand for independent ruling on release of Mandelson files – UK politics live,"Former deputy PM says allowing intelligence and security committee to rule on redactions would help ‘keep public confidence in the process’ Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Peter Walker is the Guardian’s senior political correspondent. For all that the Conservatives are very understandably putting Keir Starmer under pressure about Peter Mandelson, it does seem as if their outrage about his appointment is slightly retrospective. Asked if the party had raised Mandelson’s continued links to Jeffrey Epstein after the latter had been jailed for trafficking, which was in the public domain at the time, Kemi Badenoch’s spokesperson said this was “a fair challenge” and that he could not recall it being raised by the party. I imagine there would be various quotes on the record about the fact that this is a man who had been sacked from cabinet twice for misconduct. So I imagine there were some [Conservative] voices around, you know, whether this was a sound appointment. Asked if the party had actively opposed Mandelson getting the role at the time, he added: “I can’t remember.” Labour MPs have warned they will vote down a government amendment to limit the disclosures about Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador, with government sources saying they may be forced to change their own amendment, Jessica Elgot reports. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the goverment would comply with the motion as amended. He said going through all the Mandelson documents – “a significant amount” – would take some time. But the government would “start that process of disclosure, to the extent it can do, today”, he said. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said that there would be a “high bar” for accepting a manuscript amendment this afternoon (see 1.57pm), but he said that there was a lot to clear up and he was willing to do that. Jeremy Wright (Con) said Thomas-Symonds’ comment about the ISC was helpful. (See 1.59pm.) He said it would be helpful to have an assurance that everything would be disclosed, either to the ISC or to the whole house. Thomas-Symonds said his previous comment was “in good faith”. Thomas-Symonds told MPs that the ISC would play a role in the Cabinet Office process deciding what Mandelson material gets released. Clive Efford (Lab) intervened to ask if it would be possible for someone to produce a manuscript amendment (that is a last-minute amendment submitted on the day, not one printed in the order paper) saying the ISC should take over the process. He said there was a “consenus in the house” that this would be a good way forward. Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker, said a manuscript amendment would be a matter for the chair. He was the chair, he said. And he said he would be “sympathetic to what the house would need”. Thomas-Symonds said, again, he would take this issue away. Jonathan Brash, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, where Peter Mandelson was one of his predecessors, intervened to say, speaking on behalf of people in the town, he could says that Mandelson was “a traitor”. He said that it was important for the public to have confidence in this process. That sounded like a call for the ISC to take over the process of deciding which material should be withheld. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the Treasury committee, also intervened to urge the government to let the intelligence and security committee (ISC) decide what Mandelson material is released. She said that was a tried and tested mechanism in this place in these sort of circumstances. She says committees could be trusted to do this; they did not leak. Thomas-Symonds repeated the point about taking this proposal back to No 10. The Conservative MP Bradley Thomas asks Thomas-Symonds to explain why “paedophile-adjacent” Peter Mandelson was appointed as an ambassador. From my colleague Jessica Elgot I have never seen anger like this on the Labour benches in private and in public. This is the kind of territory where things can move very fast. Derek Twigg, a Labour member of the intelligence and security committee, also told Thomas-Symonds said he also thought the ISC should get to decide what Mandelson documents are released. Oliver Dowden, the former deputy prime minister, also urged Thomas-Symonds to involve the ISC. He said that would give the public confidence in the process. He said Thomas-Symonds sounded “sympathetic” to that argument, and he asked him to confirm that. Thomas-Symonds said he “heard what the house is saying”. Simon Hoare, the Tory chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs commtitee, said that, in the light of what MPs are saying, the government should decide not to move its amendment. Thomas-Symonds would not give that assurance. He said there were important public policy issues at stake. In his response to Angela Rayner, Thomas-Symonds said the cabinet secretary, a man of “unimpeachable integrity”, would decide what material should be released assuming the motion is passed with the government’s amendment. And he says Cabinet Office lawyers would be involved. But he added: I am hearing what the house is saying and I will take that point away. Angela Rayner, the former deputy PM, has urged the government to agree to the Tory proposal (see 1.15pm) for the intelligence and security committee to decide what Mandelson files are released, and what are held back. In intervention while Thomas-Symonds was speaking, she said that she had table a humble address on PPE in 2022. She said: Given the public disgust and the sickening behaviour of Peter Mandelson and the importance of transparency … should we not have the ISC not have the same role now [as in relation to a previous humble address] in keeping public confidence in the process? Nick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister, is replying to Burghart on behalf of the government. He started by saying the “depth and extent” of Peter Mandelson’s ongoing relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein’s first conviction was not known when Mandelson was appointed ambassador Burghart ended his speech by asking about a secret visit that Keir Starmer made to the Palantir HQ in Washington when he visited the city while Mandelson was ambassador. He said Palantir was a client of Global Counsel, the firm set up by Mandelson. He says Palantir subsequently won a big government contract. He says that should be investigated. Burghart said that, if the government has concerns about releasing some of the material in the Mandelson files, it should agree to letting the intelligence and security committee deciding what is made public."

Virgo, who won the UK Championship in 1979, enjoyed a successful playing career but was best known for his broadcasting. A World Snooker announcement read: “This morning it was confirmed that ‘JV’ had died in Spain, where he had lived in recent years. He is survived by his wife Rosie and children Gary and Brook-Leah.” Virgo had a dual career at the table and in the commentary box during the 1980s, but he became a more prominent part of the BBC’s snooker coverage after retiring from playing in 1994, famous for his catchphrase “Where’s the cue ball going?” He was also well known for his role on the snooker-based game show Big Break, that ran from 1991 to 2002, and was a regular on the exhibition circuit with his wide array of trick shots. Also in 1979, he progressed to the semi-finals of the world championship at the Crucible in Sheffield, losing to Dennis Taylor, then being defeated by Eddie Charlton in a third-place match. His UK Championship success at the Preston Guild Hall featured victories against Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Taylor before a 14-13 final triumph against Terry Griffiths. The seven-time world champion Ronnie O’Sullivan said: “Finished my match to get the news that JV has passed away. Love to Rosie, Brooke and Gary. Such a great mate who I loved spending time with, absolutely gutted.” Jim Davidson, who hosted Big Break alongside Virgo, wrote on Instagram: “Heartbroken to hear that my great mate John Virgo has passed away at 79. What a character, what a talent. From our time together on Big Break, to the snooker commentary chair, you brought so much joy to so many. Rest easy, John. You will be missed.” Virgo’s final commentary on the BBC came on 18 January when Kyren Wilson defeated John Higgins 10-6 in the Masters final at Alexandra Palace. “Everyone at World Snooker Tour is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of legendary snooker player and broadcaster John Virgo, aged 79,” a World Snooker statement read. “Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Rest in peace, JV.” The four-times world champion Mark Selby wrote on X: “So sad to hear the news of the passing of John Virgo!!! Such a great guy and a huge character!! He will be greatly missed! RIP JV.” Neil Robertson, the 2010 world champion, said: “He was a great character and an amazing pundit and commentator. I had the pleasure of sharing the booth with him during the World Championship a couple of years ago in which I got a huge appreciation for how good he was. We’ve lost some great people of our game just recently which is incredibly sad.”"
d7d85cb1-9395-498f-9c91-2ef4da81c971,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/04/mother-13-year-old-boy-swim-four-hours-save-family,2026-02-04,Mother says asking 13-year-old son to swim four hours to save family ‘one of the hardest decisions’,"‘What have I done?’ thought Joanne Appelbee as she waited for rescue with her two other children in rough seas off Western Australia Joanne Appelbee says asking her 13-year-old son Austin to swim four hours through dangerous waters to get help after her family was swept out to sea was “one of the hardest decisions” she has ever made. “I knew he was the strongest and he could do it,” she told the ABC. “I would have never went because I wouldn’t have left the kids at sea, so I had to send somebody.” The Appelbee family were on holiday in Quindalup, 200km (125 miles) south of Perth, when strong winds pushed their inflatable paddleboards and kayak offshore from Geographe Bay on Friday afternoon. In an interview with the BBC, Joanne explained the situation escalated rapidly while she was playing in the water with Austin and his younger siblings Beau, 12, and Grace, 8. It started with “a bit of fun” with two paddleboards and a kayak in shallow water at the beach, when the children “went out a bit too far”. “The wind picked up and it went from there,” she said. “We lost oars, and we drifted out further ... It kind of all went wrong very, very quickly. “Early on, we sent this young man [Austin] back in to try and get help because it didn’t look like we were that far from the shoreline,” she said. While Austin swam for the shore, Joanne and the children drifted further out to sea, soon losing sight of him. The sun set and the waves grew increasingly large. Wearing life jackets, they struggled to grab on to the boards. “I had assumed Austin had made it a lot quicker than he had,” Joanne said. As more time passed, she questioned whether her plan had worked. “If he hasn’t made it, what have I done? Have I made the wrong decision, and is anyone going to come and save my other two?” But Austin swam 4km until he reached the shore. “I was thinking about Mum, Beau and Grace … When I hit the floor I thought, how am I on land right now, is this a dream?” he said. “After that, I had to sprint 2km to get to the phone.” He reached his mother’s bag and rang emergency services at about 6pm local time. “I said, ‘I need helicopters, I need planes, I need boats, my family’s out at sea.’ I was very calm about it. I think it was just a lot of shock.” After the call, he passed out from exhaustion and was taken to the hospital where he called his father. He wasn’t sure if his mother and siblings were still alive. Out at sea it was dark and freezing cold. Joanne had been struggling to keep hold of her younger children, and feared the worst. “I had assumed Austin hadn’t made it,” she said. “We couldn’t see anything coming to save us. It was very much getting to that point where we are on our own.” The search party found the family drifting in the ocean and clinging to a paddleboard about 14km (9 miles) offshore. At the time, Joanne was desperately trying to reach the children, who were floating away after getting flipped off the board by a large wave. Joanne heard Grace screaming, but couldn’t hear Beau, until they turned off the boat’s engine and could locate him. “It was an absolute nightmare,” she told the BBC. Minutes after calling his father, Austin received the news they had been found. He said doctors and police officers were jumping up and down with joy. “It was a moment I will never forget,” he said. Joanne said she could only relax when the same ambulance worker who picked up Austin was able to confirm he too had survived. The family were treated at hospital for minor injuries. “It was an absolute perfect ending to have them all well and happy and sore but no injuries,” she said. Austin is still processing the ordeal, but has made it back to school already – on crutches – because his legs were so sore. He praised the “really quick response” from emergency services and the “lovely ambulance crew”. “I didn’t think I was a hero, I just did what I did,” he said. Austin told the ABC he started swimming lessons when he was four and did VacSwim – water safety lessons for children – but had previously found it “quite tiring” to swim 350 metres without having a break. Police inspector James Bradley thanked those involved in the rescue mission and said it was a reminder that ocean conditions can change rapidly. “The actions of the 13-year-old boy cannot be praised highly enough. His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings.”"

President Donald Trump has made a fresh plea for Americans to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, even as it left a prominent British politician facing a criminal probe. Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has resigned from the upper house of UK parliament amid allegations he passed market sensitive information to the late sex offender Epstein while in government. The fallout from the latest release of millions of documents linked to Epstein continued in the US too, where former president Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary will testify in Congress later this month. Trump insisted once again that he had been cleared by the latest trove of files as he faced renewed questions at the White House over the disgraced financier, AFP reported. “Nothing came out about me other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally, by Epstein and other people. But I think it’s time now for the country to maybe get on to something else like health care or something that people care about,” Trump said. Trump added that it was “not a Republican, it’s a Democrat problem,” in a bid to turn the issue back to the Clintons, and away from the mention in the files of allies including his commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and billionaire Elon Musk. In other developments: Donald Trump suggested on a conservative podcast released on Monday that Republican state officials “take over” and “nationalize” elections in 15 states to protect the party from being voted out of office. Trump framed the issue as a means to prevent undocumented immigrants from voting. Claims that noncitizens are voting in numbers that can affect an election are a lie. But it raises concerns about potential efforts by the president to rig the November midterm elections. A message from Donald Trump celebrating the 19th-century US invasion of its southern neighbour – and the subsequent loss of more than half its territory – has touched a historical nerve in Mexico, with some seeing it as a veiled threat of future incursions. Reacting to the US president’s statement, which described the invasion as “a legendary victory”, Claudia Sheinbaum, Mexico’s president, said during her morning news conference on Tuesday: “We must always defend our sovereignty.” Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, is running her own review into the 2020 election with Donald Trump’s approval, working separately from a justice department investigation even as she joined an FBI raid of an election center in Georgia last week. The US military says it shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” when an F-35 fighter jet shot it down, US Central Command said on Tuesday. Donald Trump has announced that his administration is seeking $1bn in damages from Harvard University, the latest step in a long-running battle with the university over allegations of antisemitism. In a Truth Social post late on Monday, Trump accused the Ivy League school of being “strongly antisemitic”, adding that Harvard president Alan Garber “has done a terrible job of rectifying a very bad situation for his institution and, more importantly, America itself”. Tom Homan, the president’s so-called “border czar” is set to speak to reporters in Minneapolis shortly. A reminder that Homan took over the immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota from senior border official Gregory Bovino, just days after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and the mounting backlash in the Twin Cities. Last week, at his first press conference in Minneapolis, Homan appeared conciliatory when addressing the unspecified “improvements” he would be making to the crackdown in Minnesota. He also acknowledged the operation had not been “perfect”, but didn’t actually mention Pretti or Renee Good – the 37-year-old mother also killed in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer two weeks prior. Homan also said that if local officials allowed federal officers into jails (to take custody of undocumented detainees) this could lead to a drawdown of immigration enforcement in Minnesota. On Tuesday, governor Tim Walz said that he remained firm with the “border czar” in their recent conversations. “It’s my expectation that we will see a dramatic shift in where this is at, for the better,” Walz told reporters. Donald Trump is in Washington today. Per his official schedule, he has no events that are currently open to the press. He’ll film an interview with NBC News at 11am ET, and have a policy meeting later. First lady Melania Trump will meet with freed American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel at the White House this afternoon. We’ll bring you the latest lines as they happen. Donald Trump’s aggressive rollback of environmental protections directly contradicts the promises of his “make America healthy again” campaign, according to new research. Helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump’s health and human services department has touted pledges to “transform our nation’s food, fitness, air, water, soil and medicine” and “reverse the childhood chronic disease crisis”. But the president’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is pushing the country in the opposite direction, says the new report from the liberal research and advocacy non-profit Center for American Progress (CAP). An EPA spokesperson called the CAP report “fake news”, saying that EPA is in “lock-step” with Maha and the entire Trump administration. Under administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA is dismantling dozens of environmental regulations, weakening efforts to limit pollution and has exempted facilities from clean air regulations. These actions will make children more vulnerable to many of the same chronic diseases the Make America Healthy Again (Maha) agenda says it wants to eradicate, including cancers, heart diseases, diabetes, obesity, autism and attention deficit disorder, according to the new report. “The administration is trying to pull the wool over Americans’ eyes, claiming that they care about our health, that they care about kids’ health, when in reality, they are moving so aggressively to eliminate dozens of safeguards,” said Cathleen Kelly, a senior fellow at CAP and report co-author. “It’s really been heartbreaking to watch.” The EPA spokesperson said the agency is delivering on its mandate to overturn “wasteful” policies “while also protecting the environment and public health”. “We have banked environmental win after environmental win, and under president Trump and administrator Zeldin, children and families are safer and healthier than ever,” the person said. The billionaire investor Ken Griffin has accused Donald Trump’s administration of “enriching” its families, and criticised its interference in American businesses as “distasteful”. Griffin, who is the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel and a large Republican donor, rebuked the Trump administration, saying it “has definitely made missteps in choosing decisions or courses that have been very, very enriching to the families of those in the administration”. “That calls into question, is the public interest being served?” he said at a conference on Tuesday in Florida hosted by the Wall Street Journal. Griffin is one of the most vocal critics of Trump on Wall Street, although it is the first time he has commented on how the president’s family appear to have made financial gain from their proximity to the White House. Trump’s eldest sons, Don Jr and Eric, have benefited from the White House’s crypto-friendly policies, and have secured a series of big business deals since their father’s re-election. They have previously insisted there was a “huge wall” between their moneymaking and their father’s position. Griffin added that most chief executives he was friends with “find it incredibly distasteful” when the “US government starts to engage in corporate America in a way that tastes of favouritism”. “Most CEOs just don’t want to find themselves in the business of having to, in some sense, suck up to one administration after another to succeed in running their business,” he said. Griffin is a longtime Republican donor, giving millions of dollars to conservative groups during the 2024 election cycle. He did not fund Trump’s re-election campaign, but after Trump won, he gave $1m to the president’s inaugural committee. The power to enforce immigration law rests with the federal government. But Trump adviser, Stephen Miller, has a vision for states working in coordination with federal immigration officials, and he’s attempting to test it out in Tennessee. Earlier this month, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that Miller had been meeting in Washington DC with Tennessee speaker of the house, Cameron Sexton, to craft model legislation for states around the country. A few weeks later, the speaker announced a suite of eight bills that would turn state and local police officers, judges, teachers, social workers and others into an auxiliary extension of the federal immigration system. It makes the presence of an undocumented person with a final deportation order a state crime in Tennessee. And it mandates that officials report the presence of undocumented persons to ICE, while criminalizing disclosure of information about immigration enforcement activities to the public. “The president’s behind us,” said Knoxville-area representative and deputy speaker, Jason Zachary, on a video taken from a talk with a conservative group, describing Sexton’s contact with Miller. “The president has promised his support on social media for us, and we are being told Tennessee will go first.” A new tranche of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed several communications with William J Burns, a career diplomat who would go on to become the central intelligence director under Joe Biden. The documents describe the planning for meetings between Burns and Epstein, two of which occurred, and show Epstein texting with Burns and recommending that other people in his orbit meet with him. The meetings and correspondence occurred after Epstein had pleaded guilty to prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008, including solicitation of prostitution with a minor under the age of 18. A spokesperson for Burns told the Guardian that the two men had “no relationship”, and that Burns “did not know anything about him, other than that he was introduced as an expert in the financial services sector”. The spokesperson said Burns “deeply regrets ever meeting with him”. Burns has never been accused of any wrongdoing related to Epstein’s crimes. Burns has decades of diplomatic experience under both Republican and Democratic administrations. During his confirmation hearing to become CIA director in 2021, even Trump-partisan senator Lindsey Graham called him an “outstanding choice”. A federal judge is set to hear arguments Wednesday after an appeals court directed him to take a fresh look at president Donald Trump’s bid to erase his hush money conviction. The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in November ordered US district judge Alvin K Hellerstein to reconsider his decision to keep the case in state court instead of moving it to federal court, where Trump can seek to have it thrown out on presidential immunity grounds, AP reported. A three-judge panel ruled that Hellerstein erred by failing to consider “important issues relevant” to Trump’s request to move the New York case to federal court. They said they “express no view” on how he should rule. Trump, a Republican, is not expected to attend Wednesday’s arguments in federal court in New York City, which were preceded by lengthy written submissions from Trump’s lawyers and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case and wants it to remain in state court. Hellerstein, who was nominated by Democratic president Bill Clinton, has twice denied Trump’s requests to move the case. Democrats on Capitol Hill offered apologies and promises of accountability on Tuesday amid often harrowing testimony from people who had experienced violent encounters with federal agents engaged in Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. With Republicans conspicuously absent, the forum of senators and representatives heard from Luke and Brent Ganger, the brothers of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, who was shot dead by an Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on 7 January as she tried to drive away from agents. Luke Ganger said he and his brother were there “to ask for you help” and suggested the sense of loss his family felt had been deepened by subsequent events in Minneapolis, where a protester, Alex Pretti, also aged 37, was shot dead by two border patrol agents on 24 January. “The deep distress our family feels at Renee’s loss in such a violent and unnecessary way is complicated by feelings of disbelief, distress and desperation,” he said. “In the last few weeks, our family took some consolation, thinking that perhaps Nee’s death would bring about change in our country. It has not. The completely surreal scenes taking place are beyond explanation. “This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incidents. These encounters with federal agents are changing the community and changing many lives, including ours. I still don’t know how to explain to my four-year-old what these agents are doing when we pass by.” His daughter, Ganger added, “knows that her aunt died and that somebody caused it to happen”. Democrats are launching an aggressive campaign to win back voters they lost, not to Donald Trump, but to the proverbial “couch,” as they look to regain support ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. On Wednesday, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) rolled out a new initiative called Local Listeners with the goal of targeting over one million “infrequent” voters in key battleground districts. Seeking to build on the party’s string of off-year election victories, which extended into 2026 with an upset in Texas last weekend, the DNC is betting that early, localized outreach will be crucial in winning back these voters’ trust – and their ballots – this time around. “If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them,” DNC chair Ken Martin said in a statement, shared in advance with the Guardian. “This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come. The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters – these conversations need to happen early and often.” The program marks the DNC’s most ambitious early voter outreach effort for a midterm cycle, according to the organization. More than 2,000 volunteers have already signed up to participate in what the groups says is a sign, of “renewed grassroots energy” for the party. Volunteers will undergo a seven-week training program on how to better engage these voters, including sessions on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics”. The goal is to engage voters who cast ballots for Joe Biden in 2020 but sat out in 2024, with volunteers aiming to conduct at least 250,000 phone conversations and host more than 50 grassroots events in key congressional districts by the end of March.

Its closure will be felt far beyond its 800 students, some of whom will not get their degrees  The seaside city of Southend-on-Sea, on England’s east coast, looks grey on a winter afternoon in term-time. Its high street, bordering the university campus, is sparsely populated with market stalls, vape shops and discount retailers, and feels unusually quiet. “There used to be lots of shops, restaurants and youth clubs around here,” says 23-year-old Nathan Doucette-Chiddicks. Now, the city is about to lose something else that it can scarcely do without. Just before Christmas, Essex University announced that it would close its Southend campus this summer due to a big fall in international students, who pay much higher fees. The move will affect 800 students, as well as staff, but it will also have a huge impact on a city that has come to depend on the university in many ways. Doucette-Chiddicks, a student on the adult nursing course, describes himself as Southend “through and through”. He wears Southend United merchandise from head to toe and has lived in the town all his life. His mother was one of the university’s first students when it opened in 2008. “She used to sneak me into the computer labs so she could study,” he recalls. The campus is just a few doors from his home and, for him, has long symbolised possibility for the people who live here. His mother is now an A&E nurse and he wants to follow in her footsteps. “It’s a big loss,” he says. “Not just for students – for the city as a whole.” Over the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.  Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.  For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.   By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.  Across Essex University, which also has a campus in Loughton, 18% of students are local, but in Southend, for students training to work in health or social care, that figure leaps to 52%. Doucette-Chiddicks describes a sense of community rarely found in larger universities. “My lecturers know my mum and they know me,” he says. “A lot of them studied here before becoming lecturers.” Seventeen years ago, the arrival of a university in the centre of what was seen as a “left behind” seaside resort was positioned as a clear message of hope. Its £26m glass building, with striking views of the Thames estuary on one side and a derelict office block on the other, was there to kickstart the town’s flagging economy. It was a sign that young people growing up here could have bigger aspirations – that Southend was a town on the up. Colin Riordan, who was vice-chancellor of the Essex University at the time, recalls the optimism when they set up the Southend campus. “We wanted the university to be a place people felt part of,” he says. “We wanted to create a campus feel but one that was there for local people.” When it opened, the campus housed a GP surgery and a new dental clinic offering free treatment to local people. This was followed later by the forum – a library and art gallery shared by the university and local people. Riordan recalls watching a performance of Frankenstein in the church that Southend’s acclaimed acting school, East 15, took over as a theatre and performance space. “I remember sitting on the edge of my seat because it was an amazing performance,” he says. “And it was extra exciting because this was a town that didn’t have much access to culture before.” Over a few years, Riordan watched Southend changing: “It really did go from a place that felt like it needed attention to somewhere much more vibrant.” Suddenly it felt like there were “young people everywhere” – and independent shops and cafes were opening up to cater for them, he says. Riordan, who went on to run Cardiff University, which has also been in the headlines over dramatic job cuts, is pragmatic about Essex making tough decisions to keep its head above water. He observes that the Southend campus was established at a time when the New Labour government was intent on making sure as many people as possible could go to university, with Southend one of the first of a grand (and never fully realised) vision for 20 new university towns in higher education “cold spots”. “Back then there was a clear national vision for universities, and they were mostly publicly funded,” he says. “Now you stand or fall on your student demand.” Yet the end of the Southend university dream still upsets him. “It is a great pity. It was a wonderful project,” he says. In Southend today, alongside the more concrete impact on students, the job losses (which will hit catering staff and cleaners as well as academics) and the threat to local businesses, many people are also depressed about the symbolism of what it will mean to be a city that used to have a university. George Bejko-Cowlbeck, director of Caddies crazy golf, where students come to drink and play in the giant disco ball pit as well as putting balls, says he has spoken to students who love Southend and do not want to leave. He moved here when he was 17 and remembers that the seaside town “felt fun, like running away to join the circus”. Students are big customers for Caddies, and the drama school is an especially good source of effervescent part-time staff. But he senses Southend will be losing more than just cash. “Having the university here was a big part of the city’s feeling of youthfulness, and the idea that you can be here and learn and grow.” Lauren Ekins, a Southend primary school teacher who grew up here in the days before there was a university, says: “If I think about what this means for the children who are at school here now, I want to cry. So many children have lost access to their potential futures.” During a stay in hospital for surgery recently, Ekins met a former pupil. “She was studying to be a nurse and that was so lovely,” she says. “She was from a deprived background and university wasn’t necessarily in her future – but it was here.” Southend, which is only 40 miles outside London, has some pockets of wealth, but Ekins says lots of families are living on the breadline. She is angry that the government bailed out banks but will not step in to save universities in deprived cities such as Southend. “I feel like they are leaving us behind,” she says. Bayo Alaba, the Labour MP for Southend East and Rochford, sees the university as a “clear ladder to social mobility”, noting that students of subjects such as midwifery, social care and nursing are “disproportionately poor members of the local community who often have caring responsibilities”. The university is worth more than £100m a year to Southend’s economy, Alaba estimates. Small local businesses including cafes, bars, taxi firms and shops are braced for the loss of student customers. But he adds: “This sends the subliminal message to people who want to invest in the city or expand their business that they should be looking elsewhere.” Alaba feels the “harsh decision” was sprung on the community without warning. The university informed Alaba and his fellow Southend MP, David Burton-Sampson, out of the blue a fortnight before Christmas, he says. “It wasn’t even a sit-down meeting. It was a quick 20-minute zoom call and the decision had already been made.” “They have seen these challenges for a while,” he adds. “They should have been putting contingency plans in place and priming the council.” Prof Frances Bowen, Essex University’s vice-chancellor, says: “Closing the Southend campus was an incredibly difficult decision, which we only took after reviewing all reasonable alternatives and was a decision we could never previously have imagined.” The university has said all Southend students can finish their courses at its Colchester campus, which is 45 miles away. But Alaba says a two-hour commute each way on public transport is not feasible for many students; many cannot afford the travel costs or cannot fit it in alongside caring for their family or holding down a job. “Some students have already dropped out,” the MP says. “They have taken on debt for something they thought would change their life.” Radek Hanus, a mature student in his second year of a nursing course, has lived in Southend for four years. He only found out that the university was closing when he saw an article in the local paper during a shift on his nursing work placement. “It’s a joke,” Hanus says. “I’ve lost two years of time and money and education. People are devastated.” Hanus is registered disabled due to his Crohn’s disease. “Commuting to Colchester will cost me something like £800 a month in petrol. How can I possibly afford that?” Doucette-Chiddicks already works long hours to pay his rent alongside studying. However, he is resolute: “There are some people who have decided to quit, or they’ve just not been turning up to lessons. But I’m going to finish my degree.” By late afternoon, a fine drizzle begins to fall, deepening the gloom along the high street. The owner of a nearby business, who asked not to be named, describes the closure as “catastrophic” and part of a wider decline of many coastal places that is affecting Britain’s young people. “How can you have a city without a university?” he asks. “It’s shocking.” The Against the tide series is a collaboration between the Guardian and the documentary photographer Polly Braden and reports on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales"
12cd1b59-bd16-4d4b-b8b1-829536b00e45,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways,2026-02-04,Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far,"Lawyers discussed possibility of Epstein’s cooperation with prosecutors – and more names surfaced in new documents A new trove of about 3m files related to the financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was released on Friday, offering new details about his network and interactions with wealthy and powerful figures and the federal investigations into his crimes. The release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein-related documents. As Guardian reporters continue to review the files, here are some of the key findings so far. Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, the files show that his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors and discussed Epstein’s potential cooperation. An FBI document titled “Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline” states: “On July 29, 2019, FBI and [prosecutors] met with Epstein’s attorneys, who, in very general terms, discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant’s cooperation.” Another document titled “Jeffrey Epstein Significant Case Notification”, which closely resembles the FBI memo but is not attributed to a specific agency, notes that “defense counsel did not make a specific proposal, and they did not indicate what the nature of Epstein’s cooperation might be, if any. “It was suggested that defense counsel contact SDNY [southern district of New York] if Epstein was prepared to accept responsibility for his conduct and/or they had a specific proposal for a resolution of this case,” it added. One document in the newly released tranche is a summary that FBI officials appear to have compiled last summer, of more than a dozen tips received by the agency involving Trump and Epstein. It is unclear why the investigators put together the summary, and it does not say when the tips, which include unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse, were received. The document also does not include any corroborating evidence or indication that the tips were verified. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In response to a request for comment from the New York Times, the White House referred to a statement from the justice department on Friday, which stated that the new tranche of documents “may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos”. “Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,” the justice department statement added. “To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.” Emails show Musk and Epstein exchanging cordial messages, and on two separate occasions, in 2012 and 2013, the two making plans for Musk to visit Epstein’s private island. The communications suggest that the trips did not occur due to logistical issues. Musk told Vanity Fair in 2019 that Epstein was “obviously a creep” and claimed that Epstein “tried repeatedly to get me to visit his island” but that he had “declined”. A representative for Musk and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, did not return a request for comment about the emails. On Friday night, Musk repeated his previous claim on social media, and stated that he had “very little correspondence with Epstein and declined repeated invitations to go to his island”. The files show that Lutnick, now serving as US secretary of commerce under Trump, arranged to visit Jeffrey Epstein’s island in 2012. Last year Lutnick said in an interview that he had been neighbors with Epstein in New York, and that he had cut ties with Epstein around 2005, calling him “disgusting”. A spokesperson for the commerce department told the Wall Street Journal that Lutnick had limited interactions with Epstein and had never been accused of wrongdoing. Emails suggest that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein’s release from house arrest in 2010. In 2008, as part of a negotiated deal, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges in Florida of solicitation of prostitution and solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was released in July 2009, and began serving a house arrest sentence, which ended in August 2010. In a September 2010 email exchange between Epstein and “the Duke” – believed to be Mountbatten-Windsor, then the Duke of York – Epstein said he was in London and requested “private time”. Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have replied: “We could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy.” Two days later, he followed up by saying: “Delighted for you to come here to BP [Buckingham Palace]. Come with whomever and I’ll be here free from 1600ish.” It is unclear if the meeting took place. But three months later, the pair were pictured walking together in New York’s Central Park. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously claimed he had travelled to the US to end his friendship with Epstein in light of his conviction. The documents also show that days after Epstein’s house arrest ended, Epstein offered to arrange for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a “clevere [sic], beautiful and trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Mountbatten-Windsor apparently responded that he would be “delighted” to meet the woman. In that email exchange, he also asked Epstein if it was “good to be free?” Additional files include photos showing Mountbatten-Windsor appearing to be crouching over an unidentified woman who is lying on the floor. The files show an email exchange from 2013 between Branson, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group, and Epstein. In an email on 11 September 2013, Branson wrote to Epstein, “It was really nice seeing you yesterday” and added: “Any time you’re in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!” A representative for Virgin group told the Guardian that Branson had sent the email shortly after hosting Epstein at a group business meeting on the private island Branson owns in the British Virgin Islands. The spokesperson said that Epstein arrived at the meeting with three adult women, who the spokesperson said Epstein referred to as his “harem”, who did not attend the meeting. “Any contact Richard and Joan Branson had with Epstein took place on only a few occasions more than 12 years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event,” the representative said in a statement to the Guardian over the weekend. “Richard believes that Epstein’s actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims,” the statement added. Emails from 2003 between Casey Wasserman, head of the Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes – appeared in the files. The exchanges include a message from Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?” In an April 2003 email, sent to Wasserman, who was married at the time, Maxwell offered to give him a massage that can “drive a man wild”. Wasserman said on Saturday he “deeply regrets” his “correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” which he said took place “long before her horrific crimes came to light”. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he added. “As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Tisch was mentioned several hundred times in files released on Friday, and in some emails exchanges from 2013 it appears that Epstein connected Tisch to several women. In a statement, Tisch said that he and Epstein had “a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments”. “I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,” he added. “As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.” Bank records appear to show three separate payments of $25,000 from Epstein’s JP Morgan bank accounts referencing Mandelson, and separate documents appear to indicate that Epstein sent thousands of pounds to Mandelson’s husband after Epstein’s release from prison in 2009. Contacted about the bank statements, Mandelson said: “I have no record and no recollection of receiving these sums and do not know if the documents are authentic.” The files also include an image of Mandelson in his underwear standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. In response, Mandelson has said that he “cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were”. Mandelson was fired in September over his links to Epstein. On Sunday, he resigned from the Labour party. In a statement, Mandelson reiterated that he had been wrong to believe Epstein and continue his association with him, adding: “I deeply regret doing so and apologise unequivocally to the women and girls who suffered.” A newly released photo from the files shows Ratner, who directed the recently released Melania Trump documentary, sitting on a sofa hugging a woman, next to Epstein, who is sitting with another woman. Both women’s faces have been redacted. According to the Wall Street Journal, the undated photo appears to have been taken in Epstein’s New York townhouse. Ratner reportedly told the Journal in 2023 he did not know Epstein and had never met him. On Saturday, a spokeswoman for Ratner declined to comment to the Journal."

After one simple haircut, I was treated very differently In November 2000, two weeks after giving birth to my first and only child, I found myself collapsed in bed, breastfeeding in front of Top of the Pops, hair matted, sheets dirty, surrounded by sick-soaked muslin rags. I liked it. Or at least, it felt like a perfectly reasonable thing to be doing, until Madonna – who had given birth to Rocco Ritchie only three months earlier – appeared on the screen in a cropped leather jacket, belly bared, sexy-dancing to Don’t Tell Me. Did I feel inspired? Resentful? Brimming with pity for this attention-seeker? For sure, it was all three. As the weeks wore on, I began to see how it might be possible to shower, put on actual clothes and maybe even pop to the corner shop. Occasional visits to cafes, museums and other warm, baby-friendly spaces soon followed and stopped me from feeling as if I had fallen into a well of loneliness. But I knew that, if I was to fully return to functional human-ing, I urgently needed to sift through my priorities. What time-consuming activities could I let go of? Housework was a no-brainer but eating probably had to stay. Top of the list of useless things to do – or so it seemed in my time-deprived mania – was haircare. What was the point of hair? You had to wash it, brush it and have it trimmed. Plus, I had grey roots so I also imagined I had to dye it. There was a barber shop around the corner from my house. If I could just free up the 20 minutes it would take to get my head shaved, I’d be buying myself hours of future time. Plus, I secretly hoped there would be other benefits too. I had started to find the attention and idealisation around motherhood exhausting. I was tired of the gooey way strangers would look at me while I was breastfeeding, for example. I was also a bit sick of people sticking by my side after they’d helped me up the stairs with my pram. This constant “lovely lady” projection was getting on my nerves: just because I had a baby, it didn’t follow that I was nice. If I shaved my head and looked a bit more grrrr, I wondered if it might stop. I asked the barber for a number-two buzz cut all over. He seemed reluctant, asking if I was sure. I said yes and told him I was tired of looking “like a mum”. The actual cut took less than five minutes; I went from Virgin Mary to badass Alien-destroyer in the time it took to change a nappy. I was euphoric. It took about 48 hours for the bubble to burst. Standing with my pram at the bottom of a tube station staircase, I looked up haplessly as people scurried past. Why was no one stopping to help? The next day I ventured out alone and tried to buy a coffee at a crowded counter. I felt like a ghost. Why couldn’t anyone see me? Then I cracked, complaining that I’d been waiting longer than anyone else. This did not endear me to the busy barista, who paid back my snappiness in spades. I had got what I wanted – and it was terrible. Yes, I’d saved myself some time getting ready to go out in the mornings, but at what cost? I moped around cafes and museums looking at other women’s hair, calculating how many months or years it would take me to catch up. Any hair length over three inches would flood me with hideous envy. My haircut had made me a monster, inside and out. (Incidentally, there are no pictures of me as a true baldie. Did I dodge cameras, or did they dodge me?) I quickly discovered that life is much harder for women without swishy hair – a harsh lesson in what happens when you step outside gender norms. Dropping just one of the key markers of femininity meant strangers treated me very differently: being femme-presenting had meant getting help and approval – albeit with an occasional side serving of creepiness – while looking grrrr meant being ignored, or risking being labelled as stroppy. It was frustrating to discover how a few minutes in a barber’s chair had completely changed who I was for others. Of course, hair grows, and soon enough I was once again sashaying through pre-opened doors with abandon. And now I have waist-length, white hair, which somehow perfectly fits my neurotic insistence on conforming and not conforming at the same time. But my temporary, self-inflicted privilege dip did give me the tiniest glimpse into what it might be like to be ignored, excluded or feared on the grounds of appearance alone. And that really is an ugly sight.  The Revolution Will Be Internalised: On the Unlikely Politics of ‘Inner-Prepping’ by Anouchka Grose is out on 10 February (The Indigo Press, £9.99)"
2f8c0728-b97d-45a0-9702-847fd38ee816,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2026/feb/04/rail-firm-issues-do-not-travel-alert-after-multiple-incidents-across-south-east-england,2026-02-04,South-east England ‘do not travel’ rail alert lifted but disruption continues,"Signalling issue and train derailment still affecting Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express services The UK’s largest railway franchise has lifted a “do not travel alert” it had issued after a train derailment and signalling issues affected services across south-east England, but service disruption continues. The train operators Southern, Thameslink and Gatwick Express – all part of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) franchise in south-east England – had urged passengers not to travel at 8am on Wednesday morning “if at all possible” because of “multiple incidents”. Issues included a train derailment inside a depot in Selhurst, south-east London and a signalling fault between London Blackfriars and Norwood Junction. The do not travel alert was withdrawn by 10am, but passengers were being warned services could still be cancelled, revised or delayed by up to an hour. The train operators had told passengers: “A number of incidents across the Gatwick Express, Southern and Thameslink networks mean that all lines are disrupted. Trains across these networks may be cancelled, severely delayed by up to 60 minutes or revised.” Network Rail released an image of the derailed Southern train, which showed it remained upright, and said there were no confirmed injuries. The incident prevented other trains from leaving the depot. National Rail said the signalling fault meant fewer rail lines were available between Norwood Junction and London Blackfriars, and trains running on the available lines must travel at slower speeds than normal. Services were suspended on routes between London Bridge and East Grinstead; Orpington and Luton; Brighton and Cambridge; and Bedford and Three Bridges. Several other Thameslink routes were also disrupted. A GTR spokesperson said: “We’re very sorry for the disruption that customers have experienced this morning. A fault with the signalling system between Norwood Junction and London Bridge, along with a train derailment at Selhurst depot, are causing the disruption. “We’re working with Network Rail to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. We advise customers to check our website and social media accounts for the latest travel information.” GTR, which also includes the operator Great Northern, is the UK’s largest railway franchise in terms of passengers carried. About 18% of train trips in the UK are made on GTR services, according to the company. Great Britain’s rail operators are in the process of being nationalised by the government, with West Midlands Trains the latest, last weekend. GTR is expected to be the next operator to be nationalised, in May. Elsewhere on Britain’s rail network on Wednesday, a fault with the signalling system between Crewe and Sandbach means trains have to run at a reduced speed on all lines. This is disrupting services between Crewe and Wilmslow, affecting the operators Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Northern and Transport for Wales. A signalling problem was also affecting South Western Railway services between Portsmouth & Southsea and Portsmouth Harbour."
